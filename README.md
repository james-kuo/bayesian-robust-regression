I implemented Gibbs Sampler in R to fit Bayesian student-t “Robust” regression with Jeffrey’s prior on a dataset and compared it with Gaussian linear regression with Jeffrey’s prior. Artificial noises are added to a dataset under different settings to compare the posterior distributions of parameters of the student-t and Gaussian model. Compared model performances and robustness of posterior distributions.

`Ting_Yuan_Kuo_Final_Project.pdf` is the paper. 

`Analysis.R`, `Analysis2.R`, and `Analysis3.R` are R codes which support the main `Final Project.rmd` markdown file.

`AnalysisMain.RData`, `Corrupt.RData`, `Corrupt2.RData`, and `Corrupt2alt.RData` contains the processed datasets.
