Implemented Gibbs Sampler in R to fit Bayesian student-t “Robust” regression with Jeffrey’s prior on a dataset and compared it with Gaussian linear regression with Jeffrey’s prior; added artificial noises to dataset under different settings to compare student-t and Gaussian model, compared model performances and robustness of posterior distributions
